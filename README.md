# game-automation

A simple python script that automates the 2048 game on a web browser.
This is a simple game where you need to make a sum of 2048 by adding numbers on boxes.

The project still need optimisations and the heuristic function needs improvement.

Just run the trial_5.py script after open the 2048 game in browser.
